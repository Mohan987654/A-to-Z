Title: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews Using Machine Learning

Description:
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of reviews categorized by polarity (1 for negative and 2 for positive), review titles, and review text. The objective is to process the data, train machine learning models, and predict the sentiment of reviews accurately.

The Problem it Solves:
The project addresses the challenge of analyzing large volumes of text data to extract sentiment information effectively. By automating sentiment analysis, businesses can gain insights into customer opinions, identify trends, and make informed decisions to enhance products and services.

Use Cases:

E-commerce platforms can use sentiment analysis to understand customer satisfaction levels and improve product recommendations.
Customer service teams can prioritize negative reviews for prompt resolution, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction.
Product managers can identify common themes in positive reviews to capitalize on product strengths and address areas of improvement.


Challenges Encountered:

Cleaning and preprocessing large datasets to remove noise and irrelevant information.
Selecting and training machine learning models that accurately classify the sentiment of reviews across different product categories.
Ensuring scalability and efficiency in processing and analyzing a vast amount of review data.

Exact Steps to Test the Project:

Access the deployed system through the provided URL or interface.
Input a sample Amazon review into the system.
Observe the predicted sentiment (positive or negative) generated by the system.
Compare the predicted sentiment with the actual sentiment of the review to evaluate the accuracy of the system.
Repeat the testing process with multiple reviews to assess the system's consistency and reliability.
